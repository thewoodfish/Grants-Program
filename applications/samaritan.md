## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Samaritan is a decentralized backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that offers Firebase-like APIs for building real-time Web3 applications.

### Overview

**Samaritan** is a modern backend for Web3 apps, offering real-time document sync, wallet-based authentication, and a serverless function layer for event-driven logic â€” all without relying on centralized infrastructure. It enables developers to build collaborative, reactive dApps with the speed and simplicity of Firebase, but with the principles of decentralization at its core.


**Integration with Substrate / Polkadot**  
Samaritan integrates seamlessly with the Polkadot ecosystem via:

- **Wallet-based authentication** using Polkadot.js
- **Event listeners** for Ink! smart contracts
- **Off-chain triggers** responding to on-chain activity


**Why Weâ€™re Building This**

Firebase revolutionized app development by giving developers instant access to tools for real-time data, authentication, and cloud functions â€” allowing rapid iteration without backend complexity. But Firebase is a closed, centralized service â€” unsuitable for the Web3 vision of trustless, user-owned infrastructure.

Samaritan brings the Firebase experience to Web3: fast to integrate, powerful for real-time collaboration, and aligned with decentralization. Developers get a familiar stack â€” instant auth, real-time sync, and programmable logic â€” while users retain control over identity and data. Samaritan helps dApp teams move quickly without giving up sovereignty or composability.

### Project Details

**Samaritan** is a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) designed for decentralized applications. It brings the simplicity and power of Firebase â€” including real-time data updates, plug-and-play authentication, and reactive backend logic â€” into the Web3 world, without compromising on decentralization or user ownership.

Instead of relying on centralized services, Samaritan uses **wallet-based authentication** (e.g., Polkadot.js, MetaMask) and connects directly to **blockchain smart contracts** for event-based triggers. It enables a two-way interaction model: smart contracts can emit events that trigger backend logic, and backend logic can also invoke smart contracts when needed.

Rather than replicating all of Firebase, Samaritan focuses on the core features that matter most for dApp developers â€” **authentication**, **real-time sync**, and **serverless function execution** â€” all built to be modular, decentralized, and chain-agnostic.


#### Key Features of Samaritan

1. Decentralized Authentication
Samaritan replaces traditional email-and-password systems with a seamless, wallet-based login experience. Users authenticate using cryptographic signatures from wallets like MetaMask or Polkadot.js, allowing for secure, passwordless access without reliance on centralized identity providers. This form of authentication is inherently self-sovereignâ€”users own and control their identity entirelyâ€”and it's interoperable across apps, making it easy for developers to support cross-platform login while respecting user privacy and autonomy.
2. Real-Time Document Sync
Samaritan includes a real-time, peer-to-peer document database built in Rust, designed for speed, safety, and collaboration at scale. It tracks structured JSON data and supports live updates across users and devices, enabling features like shared state, presence, and history. Powered by SwarmNL, it achieves low-latency communication without relying on a central server. While CRDTs may be used internally to handle conflict resolution, the core abstraction remains a developer-friendly document store â€” not a merge engine. This makes it ideal for building real-time dashboards, multiplayer apps, co-editing tools, and any product that benefits from decentralized, responsive state.
3. Smart Contract Event Integration  
Samaritan enables bi-directional interaction with smart contracts, bringing dynamic, event-driven logic to Web3 apps. On one hand, developers can register functions that react to on-chain eventsâ€”like minting an NFT or updating a DAO proposalâ€”executing off-chain code securely in response. On the other hand, Samaritan can also trigger smart contracts based on backend logic or user actions (e.g., writing to the database, reaching a threshold, or invoking a workflow). These interactions are processed through a lightweight function runtime that mirrors cloud functionsâ€”without central infrastructureâ€”enabling powerful automation between on-chain and off-chain systems.

This makes it ideal for building collaborative Web3 applications â€” from multiplayer tools and real-time dashboards to automated workflows and co-editors â€” all on decentralized infrastructure.
This makes it ideal for building collaborative apps like editors, shared dashboards, or multiplayer tools â€” all on Web3 infrastructure.

Samaritan builds on our earlier work developing [SwarmNL](https://github.com/algorealmInc/SwarmNL), a lightweight peer-to-peer networking layer designed for real-time synchronization without centralized servers, built on libp2p. With this, we are able to bring real-time, decentralized communication patterns to Samaritan â€” allowing users and devices to sync data directly, securely, and with minimal latency. SwarmNLâ€™s architecture forms the backbone of Samaritanâ€™s real-time update engine.

#### ðŸ”§ Stack

- Rust (Core Infrastructure)
- TypeScript/JavaScript (SDKs/API library)
- React (Admin Dashboard)

#### What Samaritan is not
Samaritan is not a blockchain or smart contract platform. It doesn't aim to create a new consensus layer, token economy, or on-chain execution environment. Instead, it integrates with existing chains like Ethereum and Polkadot for authentication, data anchoring, and event-driven workflows.

It also isnâ€™t trying to replicate Firebase feature-for-feature. Services like analytics, crash reporting, or deep user segmentation are out of scope for the MVP. Samaritan is focused on solving three core backend primitives for Web3 apps: authentication, real-time data sync, and smart contract integration. Additional features will be considered based on real developer needs and community feedback.

### Ecosystem Fit
Samaritan fits into the Polkadot ecosystem as a lightweight developer tool for real-time data sync, decentralized identity, and smart contract event integration. It provides essential backend primitivesâ€”like wallet-based authentication, live peer-to-peer collaboration, and contract-triggered workflowsâ€”that parachains, dApps, and wallets can use without depending on centralized infrastructure.

Rather than trying to be a full-featured platform, Samaritan focuses on enabling these foundational capabilities in a modular, pluggable way that supports Polkadotâ€™s vision of interoperability, trustlessness, and developer empowerment.


#### ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience

Our primary target audience includes:

- **dApp developers** who need real-time, collaborative features like shared dashboards, multiplayer editing, or live session data.
- **Wallet and identity providers** looking to extend DID systems with live application state tied to users.
- **Parachain and infrastructure teams** that want to integrate real-time app logic or contract-triggered workflows without maintaining extra backend services.
- **Builders and creators** seeking developer-friendly, decentralized alternatives to Firebase for identity and event-driven apps.

#### âœ… Needs Met by Samaritan

Samaritan solves critical backend challenges for decentralized app developers:

- **Live document synchronization** across clients using peer-to-peer messaging â€” no centralized relay or server needed.  
- **Wallet-based authentication** using Polkadot.js or MetaMask, with self-sovereign sessions and no passwords.  
- **Event-driven backend logic**, triggered by smart contract events or external inputs â€” allowing rich, decentralized workflows.  
- **Infrastructure minimization**, by removing the need to maintain custom backend stacks or centralized APIs.


#### How These Needs Were Identified

We identified these needs through a combination of:

- Experience from building **SwarmNL**, our CRDT engine base, and testing it in apps requiring offline sync and real-time collaboration.
- https://www.buildondot.com/ideas/web3-firebase/

Samaritan distinguishes itself by combining **wallet-based authentication**, **real-time peer-to-peer data sync**, and **event-driven backend logic** into a cohesive, developer-friendly backend. It is purpose-built for applications that require **live, collaborative experiences**â€”without relying on centralized infrastructure. By abstracting complex decentralized primitives into familiar interfaces, Samaritan empowers developers to build modern, Web3-native apps with minimal friction.



#### What Makes Samaritan Different

Samaritan is a unified Web3 backend that:

- Includes a **decentralized document database** powered by a custom sync engine (built on SwarmNL) for real-time, conflict-free collaboration.
- Provides **serverless authentication** using Ethereum and Polkadot wallets â€” no username/password or backend setup required.
- Supports **event-driven smart contract integration**, enabling both reactive (listen to events) and proactive (trigger contracts) interactions.
- Delivers a **simple, Firebase-like developer experience**, with intuitive SDKs and patterns for building live, collaborative apps â€” without the centralized overhead.

#### Similar Projects in Other Ecosystems

Weâ€™ve studied comparable efforts outside Polkadot:

- **Automerge** and **Yjs** offer CRDTs, but lack native wallet-based auth or contract integration.
- **Textile**, **3Box/Ceramic**, and **OrbitDB** focus on decentralized identity or storage, but donâ€™t provide real-time collaboration or bidirectional contract logic.
- **Liveblocks** and **Firebase** are widely used for real-time apps but are centralized and unsuitable for decentralized, trust-minimized systems.

#### Why Samaritan is Unique

Samaritan is the only solution that combines:

- **Real-time CRDT-based syncing** for live, conflict-free collaboration  
- **Decentralized identity** using Ethereum and Polkadot wallets  
- **Smart contract integration** for two-way communication between on-chain events and off-chain logic  

...all in a single, protocol-native system purpose-built for modern Web3 applications.

## Development Status :open_book:

We began iterating on Samaritan as a personal exploration into the possibilities of data self-sovereignty. Between its early stages and 2023, we built several proof-of-concepts including, the latest of which was known as [SamaritanDB](https://github.com/thewoodfish/samaritandb-proto1). 
In 2024, we took a step back to rethink the architecture. Rather than tightly coupling networking and storage, we decided to abstract the networking layer into a modular, pluggable subsystem. This led to the development of [SwarmNL](https://github.com/algorealmInc/SwarmNL) â€” a purpose-built networking engine optimized for real-time synchronization, CRDTs, and offline collaboration, built on libp2p.
Now that SwarmNL is stable and proven, we are in the strongest position yet to realize Samaritan, grounded in privacy, decentralization, and composability.

## Future Plans

In the short term, we intend to continue developing Samaritan into a production-ready alternative to Firebase for Web3. We plan to release SDKs and developer tools that will make it easy to integrate Samaritan into existing dApps.

To promote adoption, we will run developer workshops, publish technical tutorials, and partner with early-stage dApps that need a Firebase-like backend tailored for Web3 primitives. We also plan to actively engage with the Substrate, Polkadot, and broader Web3 developer communities to showcase how Samaritan can accelerate their development workflows.

#### Long-Term Vision

Long-term, we plan to add premium services and build more decentralized backend tools that developers can easily plug into their apps. This will make building dApps faster and simpler, helping grow a richer Web3 ecosystem.

Samaritan is part of a broader vision weâ€™ve been pursuing since our initial proof of concept in 2023. With SwarmNL now mature as our networking layer, we believe Samaritan is in the best position to define the standard for decentralized backend servicesâ€”starting with Firebase parity and expanding into new paradigms that traditional backend-as-a-service models cannot support.
